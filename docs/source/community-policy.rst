Community Policy
================

We want all players on the Top Speed SMP server to feel welcome. Therefore, we have created a list of rules everyone must follow. Failure to comply will result in ban without notification.

Griefing
--------

Destructive griefing is not tollerated on this server. This includes intentional destruction of property and item theft.

Successful pranks include both intactness following the event and the ability to opt-out. If these ideas are not kept in mind, then the prank is considered griefing.
