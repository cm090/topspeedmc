End Bust: Fight for the Egg
===========================

We will fight the ender dragon on Saturday, December 11 at 8PM in O269. Here are the logistics:

- Everyone will work together to find the stronghold and fight the dragon

- After the dragon has been defeated, the egg will be destroyed and you will be teleported to an arena map

- You will fight to the death individually or in teams for the egg

- Last person/team standing will have a 10 minute head start to find end cities

- If you are on campus and play Minecraft on your laptop, you must attend the event in O269

- If you cannot attend, you must join the Discord call during the event

- The end will be disabled until there is a winner

- You are not allowed to leave the arena once you are teleported in

  - /home, /back, /tpa, /warp and all related commands will be disabled

- When you die, you lose the game but your inventory will remain intact

- The dragon egg can be stolen after this event (it must be placed in an area where others can potentially steal it)
