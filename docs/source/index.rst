Welcome to the Top Speed SMP docs!
===================================

This website contains all the rules for the server, along with additional information.

Getting Started
---------------
In order to play on this server you must:

- Be an active member of Top Speed

- Have access to the Minecraft channel in Discord

- Send a message in the Minecraft channel with your game version and username

What is defined as an active member?

An active member of Top Speed attends floor events and is generally familiar with the rest of the floor. If you do not participate in floor-related activities, you are not an active member and therefore will not be granted access to the server.
