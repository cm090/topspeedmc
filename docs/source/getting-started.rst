Getting Started
===============

Wait for an admin to whitelist you before continuing. On either Minecraft Java or Bedrock edition, connect to a new server. Enter a name and the IP mc.topspeed.rhit.cf, but keep all other values the same. Join the server once it has been added to your list.

If playing on Bedrock edition, you must attempt to join the server before you can be added to the whitelist. You will receive an error the first time you join, but shoudl be able to connect the second time. You will only have to do this once.
