Getting Started
===============
.. topic:: **In order to play on this server you must:**

  - Be an active member of Top Speed

  - Have access to the Minecraft channel in Discord

  - Send a message in the Minecraft channel with your game version and username

.. topic:: **What is defined as an active member?**

  An active member of Top Speed attends floor events and is generally familiar with the rest of the floor. If you do not participate in floor-related activities, you are not an active member and therefore will not be granted access to the server.

.. topic:: **Next Steps**

  Wait for an admin to whitelist you before continuing. On either Minecraft Java or Bedrock edition, connect to a new server. Enter a name and the IP mc.topspeed.rhit.cf, but keep all other values the same. Join the server once it has been added to your list.

  If playing on Bedrock edition, you must attempt to join the server before you can be added to the whitelist. You will receive an error the first time you join, but shoudl be able to connect the second time. You will only have to do this once.
  
.. topic:: **Commands**

  All server members (Speedsters) are given access to a select number of commands. These include:
  
  - /echest (open your personal ender chest)
  
  - /back (teleport to previous location after warp or death)
  
  - /home and /sethome (create a personal warp to your base)
  
  - /msg (send a private message to another player)
  
  - /top (teleport to the top of the map)
  
  - /tpa (send teleport requests to other players)
  
  - /tpr (teleport to a random location)
  
  - /warp (warp to a location defined by admins)
  
  - /workbench (open a crafting table)
  
  - /list (show all online players)
  
  Moderators can use all of the above commands, but also have access to:
  
  - /admingui (a set of moderation tools)
  
  - /broadcast (send a server-wide message)
  
  - /ban and /kick (prevent a player from accessing the server)
  
  - /mute (prevent a player from sending chat messages)
  
  - /seen (check the last time a player was online)
  
  - /tp (teleport without permission from another player)
  
  - /reload (restart the server)
  
  - /harbor (custom sleep plugin control)
  
  - /lr (lag remover plugin)
  
  - /whitelist (allow new players to access the server)
  
  Admins have access to every available command. Both mods and admins are prohibited from abusing their powers. If you suspect abuse, let another staff member know and the issue will be taken care of.
